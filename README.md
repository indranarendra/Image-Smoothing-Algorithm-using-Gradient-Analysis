# Image-Smoothing-Algorithm-using-Gradient-Analysis

Image smoothing is a pre-processing technique used before implementing any algorithm. 

----> Gaussian smoothing removes noise but smoothes out edges.

----> Bilateral filter is effective, but it is computationally expensive.

To solve these problems gradient magnitude and direction is used for image smoothing and to check effectiveness of this algorithm, canny edge detection is used on all three smoothing algorithms.
